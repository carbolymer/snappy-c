-- Unconstrained build. TODO: Take this out when we drop 8.10.7
--
-- We do this just so we can build with 8.10.7 and bytestring >= 0.11. It's not
-- as simple as just saying `installed: -bytestring` since we then need to do
-- the same for all libraries in the global db that depend on bytestring, and so
-- on transitively.
--
-- There is probably a cleaner way to do this, but it's the first thing that
-- worked.
installed: -all
