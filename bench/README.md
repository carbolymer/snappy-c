# snappy-c benchmarks

There are five benchmark groups, all benchmarking compression and/or
decompression on 2MB chunks of data:

1. `random`: Pseudo-randomly generated bytes, the least compressible type of
   data that we benchmark on.
2. `zeros`: All zeros (`\NUL`). The most compressible type of data that we
   benchmark on.
3. `words`: A repeated sequence of 8 bytes, over and over. Also extremely
   compressible.
4. `interleaved_words`: Repeated sequences of 8 bytes, separated by 8 random
   bytes in between. Meant to occupy a space on the "compressibility" spectrum
   in between `random` and `words`.
5. `combined`: All of the above types of data.

`combined` is meant to capture performance on all the types of data meantioned
above, so it's a good one to use if looking for regressions or more balanced
performance metrics.

Run all benchmarks with:
```
cabal run bench-snappy-c
```

Or just the combined with:
```
cabal run bench-snappy-c -- 'combined'
```
